# Energy Consumption Prediction

This project applies a **Linear Regression** model to estimate the energy consumption of an apartment based on various factors such as temperature, humidity, time of day, and house dimensions.  
The project is being conducted in cooperation with **Emanuele Piccolo, Alessandro Rossi, and Federico Riva ([@fede-mat](https://github.com/fede-mat))**.
